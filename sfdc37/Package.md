# Salesforce Connector

## Salesforce
Salesforce is the worldâ€™s #1 CRM platform that employees can access entirely over the Internet (https://www.salesforce.com)

The Salesforce connector which is implemented in ballerina allows you to access the Salesforce REST API. SalesforceConnector covers the basic functionalities as well as the high level functionalities of the REST API. (https://developer.salesforce.com/page/REST_API)

Ballerina is a strong and flexible language. Also it is JSON friendly. It provides an integration tool which can be used to integrate the Salesforce API with other endpoints.  It is easy to write programs for the Salesforce API by having a connector for Salesforce. Therefor the Salesforce connector allows you to access the Salesforce REST API through Ballerina easily. 

Salesforce connector actions are being invoked by a ballerina main function. The following section provides you the details on how to use Ballerina Salesforce connector.

##### Example
 * Request

 ```ballerina
import wso2/salesforce as sf;
 import ballerina/io;
 
    public function main (string[] args) {
        endpoint Client salesforceClient {
            oauth2Config:{
                             accessToken:accessToken,
                             baseUrl:url,
                             clientId:clientId,
                             clientSecret:clientSecret,
                             refreshToken:refreshToken,
                             refreshTokenEP:refreshTokenEndpoint,
                             refreshTokenPath:refreshTokenPath,
                             clientConfig:{}
                         }
        };
    
        json|sf:SalesforceConnectorError response = salesforceClient -> getAvailableApiVersions();
            match response {
                json jsonRes => {
                    io:println(jsonRes);
                }
        
                sf:SalesforceConnectorError err => {
                    io:println(err);
