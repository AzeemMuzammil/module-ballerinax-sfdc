# Salesforce Endpoint

## Salesforce
[Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) is the worldâ€™s #1 CRM platform 
that employees can access entirely over the Internet

The Salesforce endpoint which is implemented in ballerina allows you to access the Salesforce REST API. 
Salesforce Endpoint covers the basic functionality as well as the high level functionality 
of the [REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/REST_API).

Ballerina is a strong and flexible language. Also it is JSON friendly. 
It provides an integration tool which can be used to integrate the Salesforce API with other endpoints. 
It is easy to write programs for the Salesforce API by having an endpoint for Salesforce. 
Therefor it allows you to access the Salesforce REST API through Ballerina easily. 

Salesforce endpoint actions are being invoked by a ballerina main function. 
The following section provides you the details on how to use Ballerina Salesforce endpoint.
